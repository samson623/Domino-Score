# Pull Request: Filesystem-backed Players and Teams API + Frontend Integration

## 🎯 Summary

This pull request implements a comprehensive filesystem-backed API system for players and teams management, replacing the previous Supabase-dependent implementation with a lightweight, file-based approach. The changes include new API endpoints, enhanced team management functionality, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## 📋 Changes Made

### 🆕 New Features

#### API Endpoints
- **Teams API** (`/api/teams/index.ts`): Complete CRUD operations for team management
  - GET: Retrieve all teams
  - POST: Create new teams with automatic player deduplication
  - Filesystem-based storage using `database/teams.json`
  - Automatic player name normalization and sorting

- **Team Members API** (`/api/teams/[id]/members.ts`): Advanced team membership management
  - GET: Fetch team members with role information
  - POST: Add new members to teams
  - PUT: Update member roles and status
  - DELETE: Remove members from teams
  - Role-based access control (owner, admin, member)
  - JWT authentication integration

#### Database Schema Updates
- Enhanced `database/schema.sql` with comprehensive table structures:
  - `user_profiles`: User management with avatar support
  - `games`: Game tracking with JSONB player and score data
  - `game_sessions`: Real-time game state management
  - `leaderboard`: Performance tracking and statistics
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
  - Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Demo System** (`tests/demo-player-team-sync.js`): Interactive demonstration of player-team synchronization
- **Automated Testing** (`tests/player-team-sync-automated-test.js`): Comprehensive test suite
- **HTML Test Interface** (`tests/player-team-sync-test.html`): Browser-based testing environment
- **Team Sync Tests** (`tests/team-sync-test.js`): Specialized team synchronization validation

### 🔧 Modified Files

#### Documentation
- `PRs/feat-api-players-teams-backend.md`: Consolidated into this PR document

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Architecture Changes

1. **Filesystem Storage**: Transitioned from database-dependent to file-based storage for improved portability
2. **API Consolidation**: Merged related endpoints for better maintainability
3. **Enhanced Security**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
4. **Data Normalization**: Automatic player name sorting and deduplication
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Key Implementation Features

- **Atomic Operations**: File operations with proper error handling and rollback
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing for frontend integration
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **Validation**: Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## 🧪 Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing
1. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints tested with various input scenarios
2. **Error Handling**: Validated error responses for invalid inputs
3. **Authentication**: JWT token validation and role-based access
4. **File Operations**: Filesystem read/write operations under various conditions

### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function testing with mock data
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API workflow validation
- **Synchronization Tests**: Player-team relationship consistency
- **Browser Tests**: Frontend integration validation

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Team creation and retrieval
- ✅ Player deduplication logic
- ✅ Member management operations
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Error handling scenarios
- ✅ File system operations
- ✅ Data validation and sanitization

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js environment with filesystem access
- Environment variables for JWT secrets and Supabase configuration
- Write permissions for `database/` directory

### Performance Impact
